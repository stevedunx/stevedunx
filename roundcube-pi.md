# How I got Roundcube working on Raspbian on the Raspberry Pi

Firstly, I tried `sudo apt-get install roundcube`. Be careful that, if you are using defaults, your admin user needs to be identified by ident, whereas your roundcube user needs to be identified by password.

I got it working this way, but the version I found installed was 0.7 and did not allow me to install the plugins that I wanted.
